This is the code repository for a simple HTML/JavaScript canvas game called "Infinite Maze Game". 
This game's implementation makes use of the DFS algorithm (shoutout EECS 281) to generate mazes "infinitely" each time the player completes the current maze. 

by Sam Hollo from 18 to 21 Nov 2024 as a final project for SI 339.
